Sample Repository with basic web scrapping


## Welcome DSAC Students.

 I'm Sumanth, 

### You can find all the resources here.

- [Presentation Link](http://example.com/)

### Environment Needed 
- Python 3 🐍
- The below mentioned Python Packages 📦

    - `pip install lxml`
    - `pip install requests`
    - `pip install gTTS` (Optional)

#### Why Should i use these packages?

#### [LXML](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/):
> **lxml** is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt
> libraries. It provides safe and convenient access to these libraries
> using the ElementTree API.

#### [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/):

> **Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to
> manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT`
> & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

####  [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/):

> **gTTS** (_Google Text-to-Speech_), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translate's text-to-speech API. Write spoken
> `mp3` data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further
> audio manipulation, or `stdout`. Or simply pre-generate Google
> Translate TTS request URLs to feed to an external program.
